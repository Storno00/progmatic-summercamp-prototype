                    <h2>THE SHORT HISTORY OF THE ICONIC POLAROID</h2>
                    <p class="text">While on vacation with his family in 1944, Land’s three-year-old daughter asked him why she couldn’t see the picture he had just taken of her on his camera. Within the same day, the prolific inventor claimed he came up with the camera design, the film, and chemistry that could accomplish his daughter’s wish. It was another three years until he finally realized his vision and presented instant camera film to the public for the first time.</p>
                    <p class="text">Land’s invention was a huge milestone in the history of photography, as it transformed the timely traditional process of the medium into something that took just a matter of minutes. In 1948, the Polaroid Land Model 95 camera was born, bringing this exciting technology to the hands of the consumer.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait">
                    <p class="text">The original model had two separate positive and negative rolls, which enabled the image to be developed inside the camera. Polaroid manufactured just 60 copies of the Land Camera at first, but the company seriously underestimated the demand—all of the units and film sold out in one day.</p>
